+ At the present, the air quality of our country is becoming more and more bad. The haze is more and more serious and it is bad for our health. In the picture we can see the figure of some area’s atmosphere attributes, such as AQI,PM2.5,PM10,NO2,SO2 and so on. In the picture the name of each city is connected the figure of it’s air attributes. And we can find many relationship. For example, we can see that the figure of city’s AQI is low and the air is good ,the value of the other attributes is low. Also,the value of AQI and the value of PM2.5 is becoming linear relationship. 
+ We can clearly see that the air quality situation in each city through the figure . This figure shows the air quality situation at October. We can do better in the future. We also want to describe each day of years and each city of our country.  So that we can predict the air quality situation.
