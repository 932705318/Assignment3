#Data#

 we searched the data from National Data and transformed it to CSV.

#Description of our work#

We visualized the age distribution of China in the past ten years, we found that the number of 0 to 14 years old people reduced by one million year by year and the old people who were over 65 increased by 3 to 4 million  at the same time.So we can see from the bar chart the the rate of this two RECs is on the decrease.

#Gain
 
After the two homework we all learn much knowledge about D3 and visualization.And we get along well with each other.What's more we know a little about web development,I think this is great experince for us. Maybe the two assignments are not good but we leran the basis about D3 and javascript and we may make it good at final projection.
