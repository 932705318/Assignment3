# Word Cloud by Zhang baoting and Song Mengdie

##Library we use£º
+ d3.js
+ jquery.min.js
+ d3.layout.cloud.js

##Note:
+ Please open d3-cloud-master\examples\simple-fork.html by Chrome

##Our Work:
+ We use library d3.layout.cloud.js to show the word cloud.
+ Users can interact by pressing one of the word.
+ Users can rearrange the size of the word cloud by typing in the height and width.
+ Due to the time limit, we can just show the words by randomness.
+ For our work in next phase, we will adjust the size of the word by its frequency.
