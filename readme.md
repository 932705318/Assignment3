#Assignment III: Text/Spatiotemporal/Multivariate data Visualization
 
##Description
+ Our assignment consist of two parts this time. The first part is a text visualization. The second part is a space-time visualization. 

###The First Part : Use the index.html
+ In the first part we make a tree to show our growing-up experience. There include our age, our height, our weight and our scores at our every growing-up stage. We can know our own development and difference clearly.

###The Second Part : Use the map.html
+ In the second part we use a map of China to visualize the Gross Regional Product, the Value-added of the Primary Industry, the Value-added of the Secondary Industry and the Value-added of the Tertiary Industry of all provinces between 2004 to 2013. We use many pie graphs to show the percentages of these indexes. And if we move our mice to the pie grades we will get the detailed information of all provinces. We want to show the change and development in our motherland.

###Data Obtainment :

####The First Part :
+ First we manufacture some data according to our experience.
+ Second we format the data to a format which we need. 

####The Second Part :
+ First we obtain the data from the web of National Bureau of Statistics of the People's Republic of China.
+ Link : [National Bureau of Statistics of the People's Republic of China](http://www.stats.gov.cn/)
+ Second we format the data to a format which we need. And we format our data to 12 json documents.
 
###Data Description :

####The First Part :
+ There include our age, our height, our weight and our scores at our every growing-up stage.

####The Second Part :
+ There include the Gross Regional Product, the Value-added of the Primary Industry, the Value-added of the Secondary Industry and the Value-added of the Tertiary Industry of all provinces between 2004 to 2013.
 
###Methodology :

####The First Part :
+ 

####The Second Part :
+ 
 
###Find Knowledge from the Visualization :

####The First Part :
+ 1.We can know our own development and difference clearly at our every growing-up stage.
+ 2.When did we grow fast? When were our grades good? We can find.

####The Second Part :
+ 1.We can learn about how our country's economic indicators change.
+ 2.We can learn about the comparison of all provinces every year. We use the size of the pie grade to represent the quantity of the Gross Regional Product.
+ 3.We can use the axis to choose the year which is between 2004 and 2013.
