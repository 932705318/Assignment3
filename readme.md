#Introduction of Assignment3：

###1.Description:
	In real life, the college system is composed by different departments, the departments are consist of many classes and each class may have a number of groups for students. Similarly, a company may also have a lot of branches, each branch has a number of departments and a department has several employees. The visualization of this task is to show the company’s different levels by a Tilford tree. This means of visualization is very suitable for the data constructed by different levels. The company is the root, the different departments are the branches and the employees are the leaves of the tree.
Just be clear, the data is downloaded from the Internet.

###2.Process：
	Although we have never learned JS before, we had completed task II. Therefore, after studying some examples, we accomplish the visualization.

	If you want to see nodes on the path clearly, you can set the two drop-down boxes on the upper-left corner.

###3.Function:
	As we can see, we could know the specific numbers on any departments directly. If we want to check some departments, we just follow the paths and see the worker numbers of these departments. This can help the company get better coordination in different subsidiaries by adjusting the distribution of the company's staffs dynamically. Simultaneously, the company can balance the workload of different departments for the case a department’s workload is too heavy while the other same functional department is idle.

###4.Harvest：
	Not only did we get some basic knowledge about D3 and JS, but we now have some ideas for the last assignment. At the same time, we start to be interested in the visualization and realize the importance of it.

###5.Ratio：
	This is 0.5.
