#Assignment III :Text data Visualization

###1. Introduction
+ In this assignment our team decide to generate the word cloud to visualize something that cannot be seen in our daily life.
> Our thought is that we can compare the words said by somebody and find whether there is something interesting. And we use D3 and JetBrains WebStorm 7.0.1 tool to develop the project.
  In this project we tend to make a word cloud, but not simply the word cloud among all the words we get, we just make them together and generate the word cloud in different colors.
 We put the words on the screen according to the frequency of the words showed in the documents or any the user input in the input box.

###2. Description
+ Our project
> We choose **the victory speech of Obama, in the election of year 2008 and 2012**, to find some differences and changes happened in four years.

+ Details
> We put the title on the center of the page for we need people to know what it is at the first sight.
And under the title is a show box, *which is a canvas we cannot see while we haven’t generate any word cloud*.
 Below the show box, you may think it’s below the title, it’s our important function, I mean some simple and effective functions.
 They are adjusting the word size and controlling the rotation of the words in the words cloud.
 At this stage we can only put the words into the word cloud in horizontal and vertical direction, but we can adjust the percentage of words showed in the horizontal and vertical direction.
 
###3.Data
+ **We submit out texts with our source code on the Github.**


###4.Summary
+ It's very useful to use visualization in our daily life to help us analyze something.
+ And there more work we could do, compared with the example given in the Netseer, we cannot input an URL as a text, which can get the word on the webpage linked with the URL. And also we can develop more functions to the presentation of word cloud, have a better design, not this simple, and pictures are also can be played in the cloud. And more important, some better visualizations based on clouds has been developed by Yahoo Labs, the tagline, which is based on time.
